        Hi, I'm Samson. I love building things and telling stories.

        <p>
          Iâ€™m a Media Studies and Physics major at{" "}
          <span className="underline cursor-pointer">Pomona College</span> .
        </p>
        <p>
          I write a lot about{" "}
          <span className="underline cursor-pointer">AAPI politics</span>, tech
          culture, and whatever I'm learning in classes, from books and
          conversations, or just on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also make a lot of websites and webapps: recently I've been working
          on{" "}
          <span className="underline cursor-pointer">Updately, Postulate,</span>{" "}
          and various data journalism pieces.

        <p>
          If you know me from{" "}
          <span className="underline cursor-pointer">Twitter</span> it's
          probably because I was the co-organizer of{" "}
          <span className="underline cursor-pointer">Edyfi's</span> Mill Valley
          co-living house.
